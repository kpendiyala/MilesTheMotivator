# MilesTheMotivator
AP CSA Unit 2 Project - Kaushik, Kaif, Akash

Miles is a motivational bot that will casually interact with users in the Discord server and can be used to ask for advice on all sorts of topics. In this prototype, we are focused on helping give people motivational advice and playing stress-relieving games. Our goal is to have various commands that the user can type that can help relieve their stress




Command Prefix: Hey Miles,

Any Message - Miles will check keywords and phrases within the message and will interject to create AI conversation (trying to simulate a human interaction with the pot)

"Play a game" - When prompted, Miles will play a game of tic-tac-toe with the user. 

Anything that ends with question mark- Miles will search the question on search engines and answer the question based on what it finds using key words/phrases.

"Stop stalking me" - This is our blacklist command. When the user writes “stop stalking me,” Miles will mute itself and will not converse with the user unless the user calls on Miles

"Help" -The help command gives the user a basic understanding about Miles and its features. Lists out all the commands for the bot that the user can access
